# Chameleon
Discord bot for the board game Chameleon, which can be found at https://bigpotato.co.uk/products/the-chameleon.


## How to Play
The players will all be shown a grid, with each square containing an element following the same theme. Each player will be sent one of these squares in DMs. All except one. The Chameleon.

Each player, one by one, will say a word relating to the square. Since the Chameleon does not know the correct square, they will try their best to blend in.

After everyone has said their word, the players will discuss.  The players must guess who the Chameleon is. If caught, the Chameleon has one last chance to guess the correct square. This means that the players must be as vague as they can, without making others think that they are the chameleon.
